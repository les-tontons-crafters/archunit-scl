# Check your architecture in continuous with ArchUnit

![Check your architecture in continuous with ArchUnit](img/archunit-kata.png)

If you have already wondered how to check architecture rules continuously in your source code, this session is definitely for you.

You will be able to make the implicit of your current architecture explicit and avoid dependencies hell...

Arthur will facilitate a hands-on session in which we will work in mob (in java or C#) with the ArchUnit library to check:
- Architecture rules (Layers, Dependencies rules, ...)
- Naming conventions
- Team guidelines
- Class dependencies
- Return types
- Linguistic Anti-patterns and avoid them
- and much more (depending on your imagination ðŸ˜Š)
